# Angular 2 Practise Step By Step

##Overview
This very simple application to demonstrate the capabilities of Angular 2. It is not a tutorial but rather a of a teaching tool to help me teach Angular 2 to newbies. I will basically create do an hands-on Angular 2 workshop for one a day and this repo will contain the code that was completed at the end of each day. So this repo is more of a reference for me and anyone that attended the session.

##Prerequisites 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Nodejs 4.x or later](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- NPM 3.x.x or later <-- will be installed with nodejs from the above link.
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

##Commits/Tutorial Outline
You can check out any point of the tutorial using:
```
git checkout day-?
```

##Day 01
### Overview
Use `git checkout day-01` to get the work done on day 1.
This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.15. This step contains an empty angular2 project generated by angular-cli

#### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

####Employee Component
Create an `EmployeeComponent` using the command `ng g c employee`. 

NOTE: The generated components will always have
- `component.css` file for component styles
- `component.html` file for the components template
- `component.ts` file for the components logic
- `component.spec.ts` file for the unit tests

####Employee Class
Create an `Employee` class using the command `ng g class employee`. This represents the Employee Model.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

#### Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
